Inflation Calculator
This project is a JavaScript-based web application that allows users to input an amount of money and calculate how much it will be worth after a certain number of years, based on a given annual inflation rate.

Features
User Input: Users can enter the initial amount of money and the number of years for which they want to calculate the future value.
JavaScript Calculation: The future value is calculated in real-time using a JavaScript function that applies the inflation formula.
Customizable Inflation Rate: The inflation rate is hardcoded in the script but can be easily modified.
Simple Interface: The front-end is built with basic HTML and CSS, but the core logic is implemented in JavaScript.
